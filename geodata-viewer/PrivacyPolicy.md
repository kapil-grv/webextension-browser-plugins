# Privacy Policy for GeoData Viewer

## Introduction
GeoData Viewer is a browser extension that allows users to load and visualize geospatial data directly in their browser. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data and permissions within the extension.

## Data Collection
GeoData Viewer does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely within the user’s browser and does not send any information to external servers.

## Permissions Justification
GeoData Viewer requests certain permissions to provide its functionality:
- **windows**: Required to open dedicated map visualization windows.
- **system.display**: Used to optimize rendering for different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **host permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: Needed to fetch and load geospatial data from remote sources when users explicitly provide URLs.

These permissions are used strictly for the extension’s functionality and are not exploited for data collection.

## Third-Party Services
GeoData Viewer integrates third-party libraries, such as **Leaflet.js** and **DuckDB**, to enhance geospatial visualization. However, these libraries do not collect user data on behalf of GeoData Viewer.

## User Control and Security
- All data processing occurs locally within the browser.
- The extension does not track, log, or analyze user activity.
- No user credentials or personally identifiable information (PII) are required or stored.

## Updates to the Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected within the extension’s repository.
